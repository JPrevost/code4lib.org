title: Share a room anyone?
created: 1138734033

The conference hotel rates are low enough but as an independent cataloger, I still would like to ask if anyone is interested in sharing a room with me. I have reserved a standard room at the Holiday Inn Express for the nights of the 15th & 16th ($76/night plus $15.20 tax). If you are also interested in sharing a ride, I'm driving from Portland early Wed (15th) morning and returning to Portland after noon on the 17th.

Any starving student or underemployed librarian out there?
