I gave a solr-ruby presentation at rubyconf this past weekend.  My timing was off, didn't cover as much as I would have liked, and one of my demos flubbed and I punted on it (turns out all I did was forget to pass a command-line argument to the script *sigh*). 

Here are <a href="http://code4lib.org/files/solr-ruby.pdf">the slides</a>.
