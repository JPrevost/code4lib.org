First post.

I have looked this site for a while but just created an account.  I have been installing and testing various Web 2.0 services such as blogs and bulletin boards and looking into content management systems.  We've installed both Evergreen and Koha on test servers for evaluation when we replace our old Dynix ILS.  Lately I have discovered Ruby on Rails and have begun teaching myself how to use it.

I regret missing the code4lib 2007 conference but perhaps will attend in 2008.
