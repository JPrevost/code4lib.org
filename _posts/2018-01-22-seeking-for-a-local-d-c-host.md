title: Seeking for a Local D.C. Host
created: 1516654936

Looking for any D.C. locals that could host a guest for the 2018 C4L. I'll be traveling from Philadelphia by car and am hoping to bike or metro to the Omni Shoreham Hotel. I have a potential registration that could be transferred to me if I can find boarding. Our travel budget is tight so I need to reduce as much cost as possible. Thanks all!
