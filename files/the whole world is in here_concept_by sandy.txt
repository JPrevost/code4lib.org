TITLE :

"The Whole World is in here"

CONCEPT:

my main idea is about library. All of information in this world are stores in libraries. SO, i put lot of thing which come out of my mind, from computerize, music, floral, animal, war, science, history, etc. BUt I was interested to put Da Vinci drawing about human body below the "4" letter. Well it will remember to "Da Vinci Code", and i also put a book on the right bottom, to make illustration that all another things are come out from that book. 
The hardest things is to keep all of those things well arranged, but still keep them in same direction. Objects above the code4lib text are arrange from top right to bottom left, otherwise below the code4lib text are arranged from top right to bottom left.

For the typography, i put "code4lib" as the centre of attraction, and add "2009" to mark the year, and of course "coders for libraries, libraries for coders".

AS the aim of code4lib is computerize and web based libraries, so i try to symbolize it using programming code "0101010101" on the letter.

thanks for reading
