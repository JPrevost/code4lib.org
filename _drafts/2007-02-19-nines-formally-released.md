<a href="http://www.nines.org">NINES</a>, has <a href="http://www.patacriticism.org/collex/2007/02/19/a-red-letter-day/"> announced its formal release</a>.  <a href="http://www.nines.org/collex">Collex</a> is the technology driving NINES, developed with <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~bpn2f/">Bethany Nowviskie</a>'s leadership and elegant sense of design.

Collex is the basis, idea-wise, of <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Flare">Solr Flare</a>, a generalized faceted browser.

Interestingly, I've found some <a href="http://www.nines.org/permalink/list/tag/solr/erikhatcher">Sol(a)r themed NINES objects</a>.
