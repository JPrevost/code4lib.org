ObLibTopic: I'll be demonstrating and discussing Collex and Blacklight!

I'm teaching two full-day tutorials at the upcoming <a href="http://www.ossummit.com">OSSummit Asia</a> in Hong Kong in late November, as well as a regular conference session.  I'm filling in for Grant Ingersoll's <a href="http://www.ossummit.com/2007/program/talk/8">Lucene Boot Camp</a>, and the following day teaching <a href="http://www.ossummit.com/2007/program/talk/25">Solr in a Day</a>.  And finally I present <a href="http://www.ossummit.com/2007/program/talk/67">Lucene Case Studies</a>.
