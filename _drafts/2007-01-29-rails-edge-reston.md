Pragmatic Studio does it again, putting on another top notch event: <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/reston.html">Rails Edge Reston</a>.  I was fortunate enough to attend and pick up a few more gems of Ruby wisdom.  Some of the highlights:

<ul>
  <li>Met <a href="http://www.rubybrain.org/">William Groppe</a> (Mr. Ruby Brain) in person, after collaborting online on <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/solrb">solrb</a> for a little while.  Putting a face and a handshake to a virtual collaborator is important.</li>
  <li>Also met two of <a href="http://inkdroid.org/journal/">edsu</a>'s co-workers.  Nice to see so much Ruby library work.  Times they are a changin'.</li>
  <li>Metaprogramming was the very first session.  As it should be.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/about">Stuart Halloway</a> did a solrb code review and his changes will be reflected in future commits.  Speaking of Stu, he and his evil twin, <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/about">Justin Gehtland</a>, have produced a spectacular enhancement to Rails with <a href="http://streamlined.relevancellc.com/">Streamlined</a>, a way to elegantly declare a user interface to a relational database.  After seeing Streamlined again in more detail, I'm convinced that Flare is destined to be Streamlined Solr.  Justin and Stu - thanks for your inspirations, in more ways than one.</li>
  <li>Got to see many of my good friends and heros again, including Mike, Dave, Chad, Jim, Duncan, Stu, and Justin.  I met Bruce Williams and Marcel Molina Jr. for the first time.  All presentations were well done, and informative to even seasoned Rails developers.</li>
  <li>I briefly presented Collex/Flare/solrb during Thursday nights "Open VGA" sessions, though a bit too frantically.  My presenting chops were a bit rusty, and doing a 7 minute presentation illuminated the need to get a more succinct and distilled elevator pitch for <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Flare">Solr Flare</a>.  <a href="http://code4lib.org/2007/">code4lib conference</a> is the next Solr flare explosion for me.</li>
</ul>

Definitely consider making it to future <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic Studio</a> events.  There are a couple of upcoming ones: <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails/index.html">Ruby on Rails Training</a> (Bellevue, WA, Feb. 12-14), <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/railsadvanced/index.html">Advanced Rails Training</a> (Chicago, March 12-14).  If an event of interest is sold out, don't despair; sign up for the waiting list.
