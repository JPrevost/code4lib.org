I'm honored to be speaking at the upcoming <a href="http://www.accessola.com/superconference2008/">OLA Super Conference 2008</a>.  I'm presenting "Collex: Collecting and exhibiting scholarly materials" (session #406, Thursday January 31, 10:40am) and " Blacklight: the University of Virginia's Catalog on Solr" (session #1203, Friday, February 1, 2:10pm).   I'm looking forward to demonstrating these projects and sharing their latest news.
