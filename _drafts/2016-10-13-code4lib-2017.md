The [Code4Lib 2017](http://2017.code4lib.org) Los Angeles Committee is pleased to announce that we have finalized the dates and location of the [2017 conference](http://2017.code4lib.org).

The 2017 conference will be held from March 6 through March 9 in the at the [Luskin Conference Center](http://luskinconferencecenter.ucla.edu/) at UCLA. With a very large and modern conference center at our disposal, Code4Lib 2017 will be able to accomodate the growing number of attendees while also retaining that small, tight-knit Code4Lib community feeling of previous years. We hope you can come join us!

More details to come soon; in the meantime, the Keynote Committee is about to close submissions for the conference keynote speaker, so be sure to nominate a keynote speaker [on the Code4Lib wiki](http://wiki.code4lib.org/2017_Keynote_Speakers_Nominations) before Friday, October 14th. Proposals for [prepared talks](http://2017.code4lib.org/about/propose-a-talk.html) are also currently open and will be accepted until November 7th. This year, there is a new, separate process for [panel proposals](https://goo.gl/forms/q2KbVcO4ntkh6bPp1) which we are very excited about.

Also, the Sponsorship Committee is actively looking for sponsors for 2017; more information about how to get in touch with the committee will be forthcoming.

Itâ€™s shaping up to be a great conference this year, and there will be lots more opportunities to volunteer. Our team is looking forward to seeing you on March 6!
