I'll be leading a Solr workshop this February, in Taiwan, for the <a href="http://www.ddbc.edu.tw/eng/conferences/ebti-cbeta.html">EBTI/CBETA Conference</a>.  This is a synergy of several interests of mine: library-related findability, Asian culture, and Buddhist philosophy.  I'm particularly encouraged by the <a href="http://www.ddbc.edu.tw/eng/conferences/iba.html">Integrated Buddhist Archives (IBA) proposal</a> - seems like a perfect fit for <a href="http://www.patacriticism.org/collex/">Collex</a>.

The EBTI/CBETA Conference invitation came to me through my great friend, <a href="http://elib.ddbc.edu.tw/~magee/">William Magee, Ph.D.</a>, a professor at Dharma Drum Buddhist College.  Bill is doing astounding things with <a href="http://wam7c.blip.tv/">Second Life in Tibetan language education</a>, creating a program he's calling "Future Tibetan".
