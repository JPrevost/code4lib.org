<li>Reasonably near a major airport (we are prepared to interpret this liberally if the other qualifications are strong</li>
<li>Good evening venues (e.g., interesting and/or good restaurants and bars)</li>
<li>A host or hosts willing to manage local arrangements (many colleges and universities are skilled at facilitating conferences)</li>
<li>An auditorium or similar space suitable for 150-200 persons, plus three or more "breakout" rooms for 30-50.</li>
<li>Wireless network available to attendees free or sponsored by the conference</li>
<li>Some distance away from the last conference site, all things being equal (to spread the travel pain)</li>
</ul>
