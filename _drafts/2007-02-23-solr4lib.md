Time flies when you're having fun.  The <a href="http://code4lib.org/2007/">conference of the year</a>, IMHO, is happening next week.   I'm honored to keynote the second day of the conference.   Thankfully they haven't pinned me down to specify a topic.  The lead keynote speaker is <a href="http://freerangelibrarian.com/">K.G. Schneider</a>, and she's been <a href="http://freerangelibrarian.com/2007/02/next_weeks_keynote.php">blogging her preparation</a>.  I'm looking forward to her talk as well as the entire conference of talks.  I'm not used to 20 minute talks though.  I could go on for hours! (see below)

My preparation has been brainstorming ideas for months, with a Keynote presentation file constantly open where I "paint a few strokes" when the inspiration strikes.   Some high-level idea keywords brewing are: intertwingularity, serendipity, findability.   I will tie those together with the fun we've been having with <a href="http://www.patacriticism.org/collex/">Collex</a> and the fun we're gonna be having with <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Flare">Solr flare</a>.   I'll also discuss my experiences with building a proof-of-concept faceted browser of the <a href="http://lib.virginia.edu">UVa library data</a>, consisting of over 3,700,000 MARC records.  We'll see it in action, including some new and improved Flare UI.

I was shanghai'd into library community via <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/bess/?p=21">a demo</a> <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/bess/">Bess</a> saw of Collex last Spring.   She was instrumental in connecting me to Art Rhyno for the great <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/lucenesummit/">Windsor Lucene Summit</a>, and from there to a pivotal <a href="http://www.eifl.net/news/news_press_08.html">eIFL-FOSS</a> meeting.  Through all that, Bess being the shaker that she is, twisted my arm into volunteering to lead an all day <a href="http://code4lib.org/node/139">pre-conference workshop on Lucene and Solr</a>.  I've been working very hard on preparing materials for it.  This preparation has included enhancing Solr for <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-79">system property substitution</a> (making it easier to launch Solr many different ways), writing an elaborate Rakefile that:

<code>
task :package => [:checkout_solr, :build_solr,
                  :incorporate_preconf_material,
                  :index_examples,
                  :fetch_wiki,
                  :zip_it]
</code>

such that rebuilding the complete workshop package is a "rake package" away.  If you'd like to "attend" without being there, feel free to pick up the package I've built.  Details are available at the open <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/code4libpreconf">preconference discussion forum</a>.  Feedback (via that group) is most welcome!
