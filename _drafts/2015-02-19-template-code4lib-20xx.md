************* Template README ************* 
This is a general template for the annual code4lib conference page on the code4lib.org site. The styling is similar to 2014 and 2015 conference pages, but feel free to change the layout once you have created your own conference page.

The information on this page is what you should have available *at minimum*. You should have at least have these sections filled out to the best to your ability to keep conference attendees informed about the conference year-round.

To use this template:

1. Click on the Edit tab on this page.
2. In the Body field, copy all the text below the horizontal line marked TEMPLATE - COPY TEXT BELOW.
3. Click on the "Add content" link in the right hand Navigation menu.
4. Click on Page.
5. Paste text into Body field.
6. Select Full HTML for Text format field below the Body field.
7 (or before if you want to do this step before pasting it into the Body field). Open your browser's find text function and search on XX. This should bring you to all the places that need to be filled out.
7.5 If you need inspiration for prose, please look at the conference landing pages from previous years.

Feel free to add, subtract, and shift things around the template when you copy it over to your year's page, but please be mindful when you do changes to the master copy of the template.
